# -mathspeedtest

This is a Java windowed application to generate a maths speed test that students can use to sharpen their arithmetic calculation skills.

Overview of the application
The program generates a set of ten division questions. To do the test, the user sets the timer off, answers all ten questions and then submits the answers. Upon submission, the program automatically marks the test and displays performance statistics. Here a division question is defined as an integer division problem as Java programming integer division operation, where the result of division is an integer and the fractional part is ignored. For example, 5/2 gives the result 2 instead of 2.5
